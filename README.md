# Stroop Effect
Here's another exercise from Udacity's data analysis course. In this project I used descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the results of a Stroop effect experiment.

The goal of this project was to learn about different study methods, hypothesis testing and some descriptive statistics concepts, some of these are:

- variability in datasets (standard deviation, outliers, interquartile range)
- standardizing distributions
- sampling distributions
- estimating population parameters using confidence intervals
